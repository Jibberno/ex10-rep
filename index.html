        Anomidae stumbled upon the archived thread on hl2.net from 2005. He then began to investigate the mystery by
        going onto Ravenholm and confirming the Graffiti was there. Digging deeper, Anomidae finds a broken part of the
        decal hidden under the ground. When looking at the file "decalgraffiti038b.vtf" using a text editor, the
        following text was found. <br>

        FOR J.J <br>
        console: INTERLOPE <br>
        >>"Unknown Command: INTERLOPE" <br>
        console: get s.interlope.pull:27015" <br>

        On typing the commands into the console the following message is posted into the console main takeaway being
        "message from server administrator: CONGRATULATIONS AND WELCOME PLEASE ENTER WITH CAUTION YOU ARE NOT WELCOME
        HERE". The screen then shifts to a strange perspective where the player camera seems to be flicking around
        wildly. This is what's known as a Type 1 Demo. <br>

        When the command "get s.interlope.pull:27015" is put into the console a source demo is produced. Anomidae
        explains that Type 1 Demos are produced roughly 90% of the time the command is tried. These demos can produce
        maps specific to the demo and are downloaded to the machine. These maps then can be further investigated by the
        team. These demos are saved as well to the machine labeled data.dem then adding a digit to the name (data.dem,
        data2.dem, data3.dem and etc.) <br>

        The next game that Anomidae tried the command on was Team Fortress 2 and successfully produces multiple demos.
        One of the demos that were produced was the Type 5 Demo, "fortress". Anomidae widens his horizon and went
        forward to Counter-Strike: Source to test the command. The command also proved successful created the Type 5
        known as "cstrike". "cstrike" proves to be an important demo as it introduces the inclusion of a strange,
        completely black character resembling the G-Man model holding an umbrella. Anomidae also mentions the existence
        of two lost Type 5 Demos "spookycoast" and "misty.wmv". <br>

        After creating a few more demos Anomidae went back to Half-Life 2 to uncover more demos. However, around 6 AM,
        the interlope command has seemingly stopped working, halting Anomidae's ability to generate any demos. Returning
        to the graffiti in Ravenholm reveals that it has disappeared, leaving only a blank wall. Anomidae states that he
        will continue to try the command in case if they ever work again and intends to keep the audience in the loop,
        thus ending this surface level investigation entry into the Interloper Mystery. <br>

        After a fake ending, it is revealed that the previously lost demo spookycoast has been rediscovered and is
        played at the end of the video. Spookycoast begins like most other Type 5 demos, taking the perspective of a
        citizen in d2_coast_07. The citizen moves toward and inspects a house, revealing a mysterious entity within.
        This is then immediately followed by the entity, resembling a citizen model with the face blacked out and with
        glowing eyes, pushing the citizen off the balcony and into the deep waters below. In the final moments of
        spookycoast, six of the very same "umbrella men" in cstrike are seen as the citizen drowns. <br>
